Project name: hos
Purposes: Tool for creating HTTP proxy which will go through SOCKS proxy over SSH Tunnel
External libs/modules required: libssh, polipo

* How it works?
Some time you need to access to your email box (for example) from public network.
But it's not secure. To avoid "fishers" you can use your server as proxy, but sharing
proxy server ports to internet not secured too. So for access to your proxy server can
be used SSH protocal.
SSH can act as a SOCKS4/4a/5 server. But for normal work of many application it will
not be enougth SOCKS connection should be converted HTTP. For this purposes can be used
polipo.

Example of usage SSH client and polipo for WEB tunnel.
  * Connect to SSH server with enabled SOCKS on port 9999
ssh user@server.name -D9999
  * Create config for polipo
proxyAddress = "127.0.0.1"
proxyPort = 8888
allowedClients = "0.0.0.0/0"
cacheIsShared = false
socksParentProxy = "localhost:9999"
socksProxyType = socks4a
localDocumentRoot = ""
disableVia=false
censoredHeaders = from, accept-language
censorReferer = maybe
  * Run polipo
sudo polipo -c $HOME/polipo.conf
